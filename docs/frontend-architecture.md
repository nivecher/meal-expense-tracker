## Overview

This document outlines the architecture and design principles for the Meal Expense Tracker frontend. The architecture
follows the TIGER principles (Testable, Incremental, Goal-oriented, Explicit, Responsibility-focused) and is designed to
be maintainable, scalable, and performant.

## Architecture Principles

### T - Testable

- Clear separation of concerns
- Pure functions where possible
- Dependency injection for services
- Comprehensive test coverage

### I - Incremental

- Feature-based architecture
- Lazy loading of resources
- Progressive enhancement
- Phased implementation

### G - Goal-oriented

- Business domain organization
- Clear feature boundaries
- Measurable outcomes
- User-focused design

### E - Explicit

- Clear module boundaries
- Explicit dependencies
- Type safety (where applicable)
- Self-documenting code

### R - Responsibility-focused

- Single Responsibility Principle
- Clear component contracts
- Separation of concerns
- Encapsulated complexity

## Component Architecture

### Component Types

1. **Atoms**

- Basic building blocks (buttons, inputs, icons)
  - No business logic
  - Minimal props
  - Highly reusable

1. **Molecules**

- Groups of atoms (form fields, cards)
  - May contain simple state
  - Reusable across features

1. **Organisms**

- Complex UI components (forms, modals)
  - May contain business logic
  - Composed of molecules and atoms

1. **Templates**

- Page layouts
  - Define grid systems
  - No business logic

1. **Pages**

- Complete views
  - Composed of organisms and molecules
  - Connected to data stores

### Component Structure

Each component should follow this structure:

```

ComponentName/
  ├── index.js           # Component implementation
  ├── styles.css         # Component styles
  ├── test.js            # Component tests
  └── README.md          # Component documentation

```

## State Management

### Local State

- Use React `useState` for UI state
- Use `useReducer` for complex component state
- Keep state as local as possible

### Global State

- Use a lightweight store (Zustand)
- Organize stores by feature
- Use selectors for derived state

### Server State

- Use React Query for server state
- Automatic caching and background updates
- Optimistic updates where appropriate

## API Layer

### API Client

- Centralized HTTP client
- Request/response interceptors
- Error handling
- CSRF protection

### API Organization

- Group by feature
- Type-safe API definitions
- Mock services for development

## Styling Approach

### CSS Methodology

- BEM (Block Element Modifier)
- Component-scoped styles
- CSS Custom Properties for theming

### Styling Tools

- CSS Modules for component styles
- Utility classes for common styles
- Design tokens for consistency

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

- Test pure functions
- Test component rendering
- Test custom hooks

### Integration Testing

- Test component interactions
- Test API integrations
- Test state management

### E2E Testing

- Critical user journeys
- Cross-browser testing
- Accessibility testing

## Performance Considerations

### Bundle Optimization

- Code splitting
- Lazy loading
- Tree shaking

### Rendering Performance

- Memoization
- Virtualization for large lists
- Optimized re-renders

### Asset Optimization

- Image optimization
- Font loading strategy
- Asset caching

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- Feature branches from `main`
- Pull requests with reviews
- Semantic versioning

### Code Quality

- ESLint for code style
- Prettier for formatting
- Pre-commit hooks

### Documentation

- Component documentation
- API documentation
- Architecture decisions

## Migration Plan
