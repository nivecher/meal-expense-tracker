# ADR 0002: CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

* Status: Accepted
* Deciders: Engineering Team
* Date: 2024-06-08

## Context and Problem Statement

We needed an automated pipeline to build, test, and deploy our application reliably and consistently. The solution should integrate with our existing GitHub repository and support multiple environments (development, staging, production).

## Decision Drivers

* **Automation**: Reduce manual deployment steps
* **Reliability**: Ensure consistent deployments
* **Speed**: Fast feedback cycles
* **Security**: Secure handling of secrets
* **Cost**: Minimize operational costs
* **Integration**: Work well with GitHub ecosystem

## Considered Options

1. **GitHub Actions**
2. **Jenkins**
3. **GitLab CI/CD**
4. **AWS CodePipeline**
5. **CircleCI**

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **GitHub Actions**

### Positive Consequences

* **Tight GitHub integration**: Native support for GitHub repositories
* **YAML-based configuration**: Easy to version control
* **Self-hosted runners**: Option to use self-hosted runners for specific needs
* **Marketplace actions**: Large ecosystem of reusable actions
* **Cost-effective**: Generous free tier for public repositories

### Negative Consequences

* **Vendor lock-in**: Tied to GitHub ecosystem
* **Learning curve**: Need to learn GitHub Actions syntax
* **Limited build minutes** on free tier for private repositories

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### GitHub Actions

* ✅ Native GitHub integration
* ✅ YAML-based configuration
* ✅ Large action marketplace
* ❌ GitHub-specific
* ❌ Build minute limitations

### Jenkins

* ✅ Highly customizable
* ✅ Large plugin ecosystem
* ❌ Requires self-hosting or additional service
* ❌ Steeper learning curve

### GitLab CI/CD

* ✅ Built-in container registry
* ✅ Single application for source and CI/CD
* ❌ Would require migration from GitHub

### AWS CodePipeline

* ✅ Deep AWS integration
* ✅ Visual pipeline editor
* ❌ AWS-specific
* ❌ More complex setup for simple projects

### CircleCI

* ✅ Fast builds
* ✅ Good for open source
* ❌ Additional service to manage
* ❌ Cost for private repositories

## Pipeline Structure

Our CI/CD pipeline consists of three main workflows:

1. **CI Workflow** (`ci.yml`):
   - Runs on every push and pull request
   - Includes linting, testing, and security scanning
   - Builds and pushes Docker images

2. **Infrastructure Workflow** (`infrastructure.yml`):
   - Manages Terraform infrastructure
   - Runs on push to main branch or manually triggered
   - Includes infrastructure security scanning

3. **Production Deployment Workflow** (`prod.yml`):
   - Handles application deployment to production
   - Triggered manually or on release creation
   - Includes health checks and rollback capabilities
