# ADR 0005: Container Orchestration

* Status: Accepted
* Deciders: Engineering Team
* Date: 2024-06-08

## Context and Problem Statement

We needed to determine the best approach for container orchestration that would support our application's deployment, scaling, and management requirements while aligning with our serverless-first architecture.

## Decision Drivers

* **Deployment Simplicity**: Easy to deploy and update
* **Cost Efficiency**: Optimize resource usage
* **Scalability**: Handle variable workloads
* **Integration**: Work well with AWS services
* **Operational Overhead**: Minimize maintenance

## Considered Options

1. **AWS Lambda with Container Support**
   - Package application as container images
   - Deploy to Lambda with container image support

2. **Amazon ECS (Fargate)**
   - Fully managed container orchestration
   - Serverless containers

3. **Amazon EKS (Kubernetes)**
   - Managed Kubernetes service
   - High level of control and customization

4. **AWS App Runner**
   - Fully managed container application service
   - Simple deployment model

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **AWS Lambda with Container Support**

### Implementation Details

1. **Container Build Process**:
   - Multi-stage Docker builds
   - Optimized for size and security
   - Built and pushed to Amazon ECR

2. **Deployment**:
   - Lambda functions deployed via Terraform
   - Container images referenced by digest for immutability
   - Environment-specific configurations

3. **Scaling**:
   - Automatic scaling based on request volume
   - Concurrency controls
   - Reserved concurrency for critical functions

### Positive Consequences

- **Serverless Benefits**: No server management
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for execution time
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with other AWS services
- **Simplified Operations**: No cluster management required

### Negative Consequences
- **Cold Starts**: Potential latency for infrequently used functions
- **Size Limitations**: 10GB container image size limit
- **Ephemeral Storage**: Limited to 10GB temporary storage

## Alternative Analysis

### Amazon ECS (Fargate)
- ✅ No server management
- ✅ More control over runtime environment
- ❌ Higher cost for always-on services
- ❌ More complex networking setup

### Amazon EKS (Kubernetes)
- ✅ Maximum flexibility
- ✅ Large ecosystem
- ❌ Significant operational overhead
- ❌ Steeper learning curve

### AWS App Runner
- ✅ Simplest deployment model
- ✅ Automatic scaling
- ❌ Less control than ECS/EKS
- ❌ Limited configuration options

## Integration with CI/CD

1. **Build Pipeline**:
   - Builds and tests container images
   - Scans for vulnerabilities
   - Pushes to Amazon ECR

2. **Deployment Pipeline**:
   - Updates Lambda function code
   - Handles rollbacks if needed
   - Runs integration tests

3. **Environment Promotion**:
   - Separate ECR repositories per environment
   - Immutable image tags
   - Blue/green deployments

## Future Considerations

1. **Hybrid Approach**:
   - Use Lambda for request-based workloads
   - Consider ECS Fargate for long-running processes

2. **Service Mesh**:
   - Evaluate AWS App Mesh if service-to-service communication becomes complex
