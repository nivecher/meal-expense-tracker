# ADR 0001: Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

- Status: Accepted
- Deciders: Engineering Team
- Date: 2024-06-08

## Context and Problem Statement

We needed a reliable and maintainable way to manage our cloud infrastructure that would allow for version control, code
review, and consistent deployments across different environments (development, staging, production).

## Decision Drivers

- **Reproducibility**: Ability to recreate infrastructure consistently
- **Version Control**: Track changes to infrastructure over time
- **Collaboration**: Enable multiple team members to work on infrastructure
- **Documentation**: Self-documenting infrastructure
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain history of infrastructure changes

## Considered Options

1. **Terraform**
2. **AWS CloudFormation**
3. **AWS CDK**
4. **Pulumi**
5. **Manual AWS Console Configuration**

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Terraform**

### Positive Consequences

- **Multi-cloud support**: Not locked into AWS
- **Large community and ecosystem**: Extensive provider support
- **Declarative syntax**: Clear representation of desired state
- **State management**: Built-in state locking and versioning
- **Modularity**: Reusable modules for common patterns

### Negative Consequences

- **Learning curve**: Team needs to learn HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)
- **State management**: Requires careful handling of state files
- **Provider-specific knowledge**: Still need to understand underlying cloud resources

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Terraform

- ✅ Multi-cloud support
- ✅ Large community and provider ecosystem
- ✅ Declarative infrastructure as code
- ❌ State management complexity
- ❌ Learning curve for HCL

### AWS CloudFormation

- ✅ Native AWS integration
- ✅ No additional tools required
- ❌ AWS-specific
- ❌ More verbose templates

### AWS CDK

- ✅ Use familiar programming languages
- ✅ Good for complex infrastructure
- ❌ AWS-specific
- ❌ More complex setup

### Pulumi

- ✅ Use familiar programming languages
- ✅ Multi-cloud support
- ❌ Smaller community
- ❌ Additional dependency management

### Manual AWS Console Configuration

- ✅ Quick for simple setups
- ❌ Not reproducible
- ❌ Error-prone
- ❌ No version control
