# JavaScript Architecture

## Overview

The JavaScript architecture follows a modular, component-based approach with:

- **Core Systems**: Performance monitoring, error boundaries, service worker management
- **Utilities**: Logging, performance monitoring, error handling
- **Modules**: Address processing, geolocation management
- **Components**: Reusable UI components

## Core Systems

- **Performance Monitor**: Tracks page load times, resource loading, and user interactions
- **Error Boundary**: Catches and handles JavaScript errors gracefully
- **Service Worker**: Manages offline functionality and caching
- **Logger**: Centralized logging with different log levels

## Utilities

- **Logger**: Configurable logging with console and remote logging support
- **Performance Monitor**: Performance metrics collection and analysis
- **Error Boundary**: Error handling and user notification system
- **Service Worker Registration**: Service worker lifecycle management

## Modules

- **Address Processor**: Processes and validates address data
- **Geolocation Manager**: Handles location-based features

## Components

- **Reusable UI components** for common interface elements
