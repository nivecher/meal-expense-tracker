## üì¶ Version Management

This project uses [setuptools_scm](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm/) for automatic version management based on Git tags.

### How Versioning Works

- The version is automatically derived from Git tags
- When you create a new Git tag (e.g., `v1.2.3`), `setuptools_scm` will:
  - Generate a version string based on the tag
  - Write it to `app/_version.py` during build/installation
  - The application imports this version at runtime

### Creating a New Release

1. Update the version by creating a new Git tag:

   ```bash
   # For a new release (e.g., 1.2.3)
   git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Release v1.2.3"
   git push origin v1.2.3
   ```

2. The next build will automatically use this version

### Development Version

- When running from source without installation, the version will be `0.0.0.dev0`
- This helps distinguish between development and released versions

### Checking the Current Version

You can check the current version in several ways:

1. From the command line:

   ```bash
   python -c "from app import version; print(version['app'])"
   ```

2. From within the application, the version is available at the `/health` endpoint

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Terraform (for infrastructure)
- AWS CLI (for deployment)

### Local Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/meal-expense-tracker.git
   cd meal-expense-tracker
   ```

2. **Run the setup script**

   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/setup-local-dev.sh
   ./scripts/setup-local-dev.sh
   ```

3. Initialize the database:

   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
   ```

4. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run tests with coverage report
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Linting and Formatting

   ```bash
   # Run flake8
   flake8 app tests

   # Run black
   black app tests

   # Run isort
   isort app tests
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

This project uses pre-commit to maintain code quality. Hooks are automatically installed during setup.

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please see our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to get started.

### Environment Setup

1. **Create a `.env` file** with these variables:

   ```env
   FLASK_APP=wsgi.py
   FLASK_ENV=development
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
   SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=sqlite:///instance/meals.db
   GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-google-api-key
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** using pip-tools:

   ```bash
   pip install pip-tools
   pip-sync requirements.txt requirements-dev.txt
   ```

### üì¶ Requirements Management

This project uses a structured approach to manage Python dependencies:

- `requirements/base.in` - Core dependencies required in all environments
- `requirements/dev.in` - Development-specific dependencies
- `requirements/test.in` - Testing dependencies
- `requirements/prod.in` - Production-specific dependencies

To update the requirements:

1. Edit the appropriate `.in` file in the `requirements/` directory
2. Run the following command to compile the requirements:

   ```bash
   make requirements
   ```

1. Install the updated requirements:

   ```bash
   pip-sync requirements.txt requirements-dev.txt
   ```

1. **Run the development server**:

   ```bash
   make run
   ```

### Common Development Tasks

```bash
# Run tests
make test

# Run linters
make lint

# Format code
make format

# Check for security issues
make security-check
```

## üì¶ Packaging

### Packaging Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- pip
- AWS CLI (if deploying to AWS)

### Package the Application

We provide a unified script to package both the application and its dependencies:

```bash
# Package both application and dependencies layer (default)
./scripts/package.sh

# Or package just the application
./scripts/package.sh --app

# Or just the dependencies layer
./scripts/package.sh --layer
```

This will create the following files:
- `dist/app.zip` - The application package
- `dist/layers/python-dependencies.zip` - The dependencies layer

## üöÄ AWS Lambda Deployment

### Prerequisites

- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- AWS CLI configured with credentials
- AWS S3 bucket for deployment packages
- AWS Lambda function configured

### Deploying the Lambda Function

1. **Package the Application**

   ```bash
   # Create the deployment package
   make package-lambda
   ```

   This will create:
   - `dist/app.zip` - The application package
   - `dist/layers/python-dependencies.zip` - The dependencies layer

2. **Deploy to Lambda**

   ```bash
   # Deploy the ZIP package to Lambda
   aws lambda update-function-code \
     --function-name your-lambda-function-name \
     --zip-file fileb://dist/app.zip
   ```

### Environment Variables

Make sure to set the following environment variables in your Lambda function:

- `FLASK_APP=wsgi.py`
- `FLASK_ENV=production`
- `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` - Your database connection string
- `SECRET_KEY` - A secure secret key for Flask
- Any other required configuration variables

### Testing the Deployment

After deployment, you can test your Lambda function:

```bash
# Invoke the function directly
aws lambda invoke \
  --function-name $LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME \
  --payload '{"httpMethod": "GET", "path": "/health"}' \
  response.json

# View the response
cat response.json
```

### CI/CD Integration

For automated deployments, you can integrate this into your CI/CD pipeline. The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that can be configured to build and deploy the container image on push to specific branches.

### Troubleshooting

- **Image Size Issues**: Ensure your container image is optimized. The Lambda service has a maximum container image size limit.
- **Permissions**: Make sure your IAM roles have the necessary permissions for ECR and Lambda.
- **Cold Starts**: Consider configuring provisioned concurrency if you experience cold start latency issues.
