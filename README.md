## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please see our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to get started.

### Environment Setup

1. **Create a `.env` file** with these variables:
   ```env
   FLASK_APP=wsgi.py
   FLASK_ENV=development
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
   SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=sqlite:///instance/meals.db
   GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-google-api-key
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** using pip-tools:
   ```bash
   pip install pip-tools
   pip-sync requirements/requirements.txt requirements/requirements-dev.txt
   ```

### üì¶ Requirements Management

This project uses a structured approach to manage Python dependencies:

- `requirements/base.in` - Core application dependencies
- `requirements/dev.in` - Development tools and testing dependencies
- `requirements/prod.in` - Production-specific dependencies
- `requirements/security.in` - Security scanning tools

To update dependencies:

1. Edit the appropriate `.in` file
2. Compile the requirements:
   ```bash
   pip-compile requirements/base.in -o requirements/requirements.txt
   pip-compile requirements/dev.in -o requirements/requirements-dev.txt
   ```
3. Install the updated requirements:
   ```bash
   pip-sync requirements/requirements.txt requirements/requirements-dev.txt
   ```

3. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   make run
   ```

### Common Development Tasks

```bash
# Run tests
make test

# Run linters
make lint

# Format code
make format

# Check for security issues
make security-check
```
