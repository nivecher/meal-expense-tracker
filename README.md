## üõ†Ô∏è Command Line Interface (CLI)

The application provides several useful CLI commands for administration and maintenance:

### Admin User Management

#### Reset Admin Password

Reset the password for an admin user:

```bash
flask reset-admin-password --email admin@example.com

```

You will be prompted to enter and confirm the new password. The password will be securely hashed before being stored in
the database.

**Options:**

- `--email`: Email of the admin user (required)
- `--password`: New password (if not provided, you'll be prompted)

Example:

```bash

flask reset-admin-password --email admin@example.com
## You'll be prompted to enter and confirm the new password

```

## üì¶ Version Management

This project uses [setuptools_scm](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm/) for automatic version management based on
Git tags.

### How Versioning Works

- The version is automatically derived from Git tags
- When you create a new Git tag (e.g., `v1.2.3`), `setuptools_scm` will:
  - Generate a version string based on the tag
  - Write it to `app/_version.py` during build/installation
  - The application imports this version at runtime

### Creating a New Release

1. Update the version by creating a new Git tag:

   ```bash

   ## For a new release (e.g., 1.2.3)
   git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Release v1.2.3"
   git push origin v1.2.3

   ```

1. The next build will automatically use this version

## üåç Environment Configuration

The application supports different environment configurations using `.env` files following the `dev`, `test`, and
`prod` naming convention.

### Available Environments

1. **Development** (`.env` or `.env.local`)

- Default environment for local development
  - Debug mode enabled
  - Uses SQLite database by default
  - Run with: `make run`

1. **Testing** (`.env.test` optional)

- Used for running tests
  - Uses a separate test database
  - Debug mode disabled

1. **Production** (`.env.prod` managed by deployment)

- Used in production environments
  - Debug mode disabled
  - Uses PostgreSQL/MySQL database

### Setting Up Environments

1. Copy the example environment file for each environment you need:

   ```bash

   ## For development
   cp .env.example .env

   ## For testing
   cp .env.example .env.test

   ## For production
   cp .env.example .env.prod

   ```

1. Edit each `.env` file with the appropriate configuration values for that environment.

1. Run the application with the desired environment:

   ```bash
   ## For development (default)
   make run
   ```

### Environment Variables

Key environment variables (set in each `.env` file):

- `FLASK_APP`: Entry point of the application (default: `wsgi:app`)
- `FLASK_ENV`: Environment (`development` for dev, `production` otherwise)
- `SECRET_KEY`: Secret key for session security
- `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection URL
- `DEBUG`: Set to `True` for development
- `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection URL
- `AWS_*`: AWS credentials (if using AWS services)
- `MAIL_*`: Email configuration

### Development Version

- When running from source without installation, the version will be `0.0.0.dev0`
- This helps distinguish between development and released versions

### Checking the Current Version

You can check the current version in several ways:

1. From the command line:

   ```bash
   python -c "from app._version import __version__; print(__version__)"
   ```

1. From within the application, the version is available at the `/health` endpoint

- Custom rules for test files, components, and utilities
- Integration with Makefile for consistent development workflow

##### Ignored Files

- `node_modules/`
- `dist/`
- `build/`
- `coverage/`
- Test files (`*.test.js`, `*-test.js`) have special rules

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Management

The application includes a utility script for database initialization and management:

### Initializing the Database

```bash

## Basic initialization (development environment)
python init_db.py

## Initialize for a specific environment
python init_db.py --env=testing

## Reset database (drops all tables and recreates them)
python init_db.py --reset

## Run database migrations after initialization
python init_db.py --migrate

## Combine options (reset and migrate)
python init_db.py --reset --migrate

```

### Available Options

- `--env`: Environment to use (default: development)
- Choices: development, testing, production
- `--reset`: Drop all tables before creating them
- `--migrate`: Run database migrations after initialization

### Safety Features

- The script will prompt for confirmation before dropping tables
- Uses proper transaction management for database operations
- Includes comprehensive error handling and logging

### Environment Configuration

The script respects the application's environment configuration, ensuring proper database connection settings for each
environment.

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please see our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to get started.

### Environment Setup

1. **Create a `.env` file** with these variables:

   ```env

   FLASK_APP=wsgi:app
   FLASK_ENV=development
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
   SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=sqlite:///instance/meals_expenses.db
   GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-google-api-key
   GOOGLE_MAPS_MAP_ID=your-google-map-id

   > **Note**: For Google Maps API integration details, see [Google Maps API Guide](docs/GOOGLE_MAPS_API.md)

   ```

1. **Install dependencies** using pip-tools:

   ```bash

   pip install pip-tools
   pip-sync requirements.txt requirements-dev.txt

   ```

### üì¶ Requirements Management

This project uses a structured approach to manage Python dependencies:

- `requirements/base.in` - Core dependencies required in all environments
- `requirements/dev.in` - Development-specific dependencies
- `requirements/test.in` - Testing dependencies
- `requirements/prod.in` - Production-specific dependencies

To update the requirements:

1. Edit the appropriate `.in` file in the `requirements/` directory
2. Run the following command to compile the requirements:

   ```bash

   make requirements

   ```

3. Install the updated requirements:

   ```bash

   pip-sync requirements.txt requirements-dev.txt

   ```

4. **Run the development server**:

   ```bash

   make run

   ```

### Common Development Tasks

```bash
## Run tests
make test

## Run linters
make lint

## Format code
make format

## Check for security issues
make security-check
```

## üì¶ Packaging

### Packaging Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- pip
- AWS CLI (if deploying to AWS)

### Package the Application

We provide a unified script to package both the application and its dependencies:

```bash

## Package both application and dependencies layer (default)
./scripts/package.sh

## Or package just the application
./scripts/package.sh --app

## Or just the dependencies layer
./scripts/package.sh --layer

```

This will create the following files:

- `dist/app.zip` - The application package
- `dist/layers/Python-dependencies.zip` - The dependencies layer

## üöÄ AWS Lambda Deployment

### Deployment Prerequisites

- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- AWS CLI configured with credentials
- AWS S3 bucket for deployment packages
- AWS Lambda function configured

### Deploying the Lambda Function

1. **Package the Application**

   ```bash

   ## Create the deployment package
   make package-lambda

   ```

   This will create:

- `dist/app.zip` - The application package
  - `dist/layers/Python-dependencies.zip` - The dependencies layer

1. **Deploy to Lambda**

   ```bash

   ## Deploy the ZIP package to Lambda
   aws lambda update-function-code \
   ```

```

  --function-name your-lambda-function-name \
--zip-file fileb://dist/app.zip

```

````

### Lambda Environment Variables

Make sure to set the following environment variables in your Lambda function:

- `FLASK_APP=wsgi:app`
- `FLASK_ENV=production`
- `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` - Your database connection string
- `SECRET_KEY` - A secure secret key for Flask
- Any other required configuration variables

### Testing the Deployment

After deployment, you can test your Lambda function:

```bash

## Invoke the function directly
aws lambda invoke \
--function-name $LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME \
--payload '{"httpMethod": "GET", "path": "/health"}' \
response.json

## View the response
cat response.json

````

### CI/CD Integration

For automated deployments, you can integrate this into your CI/CD pipeline. The repository includes a GitHub Actions
workflow that can be configured to build and deploy the container image on push to specific branches.

### Troubleshooting

- **Image Size Issues**: Ensure your container image is optimized. The Lambda service has a maximum container image size limit.
- **Permissions**: Make sure your IAM roles have the necessary permissions for ECR and Lambda.
- **Cold Starts**: Consider configuring provisioned concurrency if you experience cold start latency issues.
