## Adding a New Rule

1. Create a new markdown file in the `.windsurf/rules/` directory

- Use kebab-case for the filename (e.g., `api-versioning.md`)
  - Start with a level-1 heading (#) with a clear, concise title

1. Structure your rule with these sections:

- **Description**: What the rule is about
  - **Requirements**: Specific conditions that must be met
  - **Examples**: Code examples showing correct and incorrect usage
  - **Benefits**: Why this rule is important
  - **Related Files**: Links to relevant files in the codebase

1. Keep each rule focused on a single concern

1. Reference related rules when applicable

1. Add a link to the new rule in the main README.md under the appropriate section
