## Adding a New Rule

1. Create a new markdown file in the `.windsurf/rules/` directory
   - Use kebab-case for the filename (e.g., `api-versioning.md`)
   - Start with a level-1 heading (#) with a clear, concise title

2. Structure your rule with these sections:
   - **Description**: What the rule is about
   - **Requirements**: Specific conditions that must be met
   - **Examples**: Code examples showing correct and incorrect usage
   - **Benefits**: Why this rule is important
   - **Related Files**: Links to relevant files in the codebase

3. Keep each rule focused on a single concern

4. Reference related rules when applicable

5. Add a link to the new rule in the main README.md under the appropriate section
