# Windsurf Knowledge Base

This directory contains Windsurf-specific configurations and knowledge for the meal-expense-tracker repository.

## Directory Structure

- `rules/` - Project-specific rules and guidelines
- `workflows/` - Custom workflows for common tasks
- `knowledge/` - General knowledge about the project

## How to Use

1. **Rules**: Add project-specific rules in the `rules/` directory. These will be automatically loaded by Windsurf.
2. **Workflows**: Store reusable workflows in the `workflows/` directory.
3. **Knowledge**: Add general project knowledge in the `knowledge/` directory.

## Best Practices

- Keep rules focused and specific
- Document the reason for each rule
- Use clear, descriptive filenames
- Keep workflows small and focused on a single task
